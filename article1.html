          <p>Imagine the things that your kid loves the most, and jot them down. Now that your creativity is flowing, you'll make easy work of <br> the planning and logistics:</p>
          <p>1. <span>Choose theme </span> — This sets the tone for your party. Pick an existing one (which the kid adores) or create one of your own. <br>
            2.  <span> Determine budget</span> — Before you start shopping, create a budget to know how much you can spend. You will want to maximise your budget by not spending on unnecessary things. <br>
            3. <span>Select date, time, and location </span> — This is very crucial and you'll want to figure these out early on. You may decide to book a venue, reserve party rentals, or hire entertainment. <br>
            4. <span>Create guest list</span>  — Your guest list will depend on the amount of people your venue comfortably accommodates. Start with family and close friends, then extend the list to include neighbors, classmates, colleagues, etc. <br>
            5. <span> Send invites </span> — The earlier you give guests the party details, the better! Send out invitations 4-6 weeks prior to allow plenty of time to RSVP. Contact us on WhatsApp if you want customised invitations that are tailored made for you!</p>
